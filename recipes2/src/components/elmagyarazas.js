const json = await response.json();

/*Here's what each part does:

response: This is presumably an object representing the response from a network request. 
It might be obtained using the fetch function or some other method.

response.json(): This is a method that reads the response body and parses it as JSON. 
The json method returns a promise that resolves to the JSON object parsed from the response body.

await: This keyword is used to wait for the promise returned by response.json() to resolve. 
It can only be used inside an async function.

const json: This declares a constant variable named json to store the result of parsing the JSON response. 
The json variable will hold the JavaScript object representation of the JSON data from the response.

Make sure that the surrounding code is within an async function or is using some mechanism to handle promises, 
as the await keyword can only be used inside an asynchronous function. For example:
*/
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('your_api_endpoint');
    const json = await response.json();
    // Now you can work with the parsed JSON data in the 'json' variable.
    console.log(json);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

// Call the async function
fetchData();
/*This is a common pattern for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript using async/await.*/






onChange={e => setQuantity(parseInt(e.target.value))};

/*
onChange: This is a React event handler that gets triggered when the value of the input element changes.

e: This is the event object representing the change event. 
It contains information about the event, such as the target element.

e.target.value: This extracts the current value of the input element when the change event occurs. 
In this case, it's assumed to be a numeric value.

parseInt(e.target.value): This converts the string value obtained from the input element to an integer using the parseInt function. 
It's important to convert it to an integer if you want to work with numeric values.

setQuantity: Assuming this is a state-setting function (probably from the useState hook), 
it updates the state variable quantity with the parsed integer value.
*/
value={quantity};
/*
 If the value prop of the input field is connected to the quantity state, 
 it means that the input field will display and be controlled by the current state of the quantity variable. 
 This is a common practice in React when working with controlled components.

When a component is controlled, its state is handled by React, and the component's UI is updated based on the state. 
In your case, the value prop of the input is set to {quantity}, 
so the displayed value in the input field is always the current value of the quantity state.

By connecting the input field to the state, any changes to the input field trigger the onChange event, 
which in turn updates the quantity state using the setQuantity function. 
This creates a two-way binding: changes in the state update the input field, and changes in the input field update the state.
*/
onClick={() => setQuantity(q => --q)}

/*
It looks like you're using the onClick event to decrement the quantity state by one when the associated element is clicked

onClick: This is a React event handler that gets triggered when the associated element is clicked.

() => setQuantity(q => --q): This is an arrow function used as the callback for the onClick event. 
It decrements the current value of quantity using the callback version of the setQuantity function. 
The q parameter in the callback represents the current state value, and --q decrements it by one.

This code is appropriate for handling a click event that decrements the quantity state by one. 
It's important to use the functional form of the setQuantity function when the new state depends on the previous state 
to avoid potential issues with asynchronous state updates.
